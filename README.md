The "YouTube video ID finder" is a program or function that extracts the unique identifier associated with a YouTube video from its URL. Every YouTube video has a unique identifier, which is a sequence of 11 characters typically found in the URL of the video.

For example, in the YouTube URL https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=123456yyy., the video ID is 123456yyy.

The purpose of a YouTube video ID finder is to parse a YouTube URL and extract the video ID from it. This can be useful for various purposes, such as:

Building embeddable YouTube video players: When embedding a YouTube video on a webpage or in an application, you often need to provide the video ID to the YouTube player API.

Analyzing YouTube video statistics: Services that analyze YouTube videos may use the video ID to retrieve data such as view counts, likes, and comments.

Linking to specific YouTube videos: Instead of sharing the entire URL, you can share just the video ID to provide a direct link to the video.

The YouTube video ID finder typically uses regular expressions or string manipulation techniques to locate and extract the video ID from the URL. Once the video ID is extracted, it can be used for various purposes as described above.
